# uConsole

## uConsole Workbench IDE

The uConsole Workbench is the primary packaged application in this repository:
a desktop source editor, CM4 emulator console, image/file-transfer tools, and
agent task interface. The release package also includes the keyboard firmware
flasher built for the host operating system and CPU architecture.

The same Make targets work on supported macOS and Debian/Ubuntu Linux hosts
(`x86_64` and `aarch64` on Linux; Apple silicon and Intel on macOS):

```sh
make deps       # install build and runtime dependencies
make build      # build the native IDE distribution tree
make run        # launch the IDE from this checkout
make package    # create build/uconsole-workbench-OS-ARCH.tar.gz
sudo make install
```

Workbench and MCP require Python 3.12+; Workbench also requires Tk. The installed
launchers skip older interpreters, including macOS's bundled Python 3.9. Set
`PYTHON` to a compatible interpreter if it is not found automatically.

`make deps` uses Homebrew on macOS and `apt-get` on Linux. Installing the
legacy STM32F1 Arduino core can require the manual architecture-specific setup
in [the keyboard firmware guide](Code/uconsole_keyboard/README.md). Override
`PREFIX` and `DESTDIR` for staged or non-default installations. Installed IDE
state and emulator images live below
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/uconsole-workbench`, outside the install
tree. The Workbench opens the installed keyboard firmware source at startup,
and the matching firmware and flashing tools are installed under
`$PREFIX/share/uconsole-keyboard-flash`.

Releases are built by GitHub Actions for Linux x86_64, Linux AArch64, and macOS
Apple silicon. Each archive contains the IDE, its supporting tools and docs,
and a native keyboard-flashing bundle. `SHA256SUMS` is published alongside the
archives. Maintainers can validate without tagging or create a release with:

```sh
./scripts/release.sh --dry-run 1.0.0
make release RELEASE=1.0.0
```

## CM4 emulator and development workbench

The [emulator guide](docs/emulator.md) provides a local QEMU build, official-image
boot, serial console, writable image overlays, file transfer and image export,
plus a Python/Tk source editor and emulator workbench. This is **partial CM4
emulation**; the guide records missing uConsole devices and platform validation.
The [full-device plan](docs/emulator-device-plan.md) maps the schematics,
firmware and Linux drivers to staged models and acceptance gates.

Live hardware development treats the uConsole as an SSH target: edit/build on
the host, test in the IDE, retain a verified host-side backup of affected target
state, then deploy and validate with an explicit restore action available.
No spare SD card or reader is required. External-card flashing is a separate,
optional deployment path, not the live-development loop. The
[physical-target workflow](docs/forge-agents.md) supports reviewed file and
standalone-service transactions; whole-system and boot recovery remain separate
qualification requirements. A successful deployment need not be immediately
undone, but its backup and restore path must be retained.

## Building source

Run `make deps`, or install the
[keyboard firmware toolchain](Code/uconsole_keyboard/README.md) and a native C
compiler, Make, Python 3, `patch`, `tar`, and ShellCheck. Then:

```sh
make all check
make flash-bundle
```

This builds the keyboard firmware, serial reset helper and modem fastboot
tool, runs the automated checks, and packages a keyboard flashing bundle for
the helper's architecture under `build/`. It does not flash hardware or
install a kernel on the build host. See the [flashing guide](Bin/uconsole_keyboard_flash/README.md)
and [modem updater guide](Code/scripts/README.md) for device operations.

Kernel/OS builds use separate source trees and toolchains: [CM4/CM5](Code/patch/cm4/20260414/README.md),
[A06](Code/patch/a06/20230630/README.md), and [R01](Code/patch/r01/20230614/README.md).
The [upstream issue worklist](docs/upstream-issues.md) records build evidence
and outstanding hardware/manufacturer dependencies.
The [Quickshell build and package guide](Code/patch/quickshell/README.md)
covers the optional Trixie desktop toolkit requested in issue #45.

After downloading the files, you will need to extract or decompress them. Please keep in mind that MacOS 11.6 or a higher version is required to extract 7z files.  
  
To flash the OS image, you can use the following tools:  
  
- For Windows and macOS users, [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) can be used to flash the image.  
- Linux users can employ the "dd" command to flash the image.  

To learn how to create an image, please refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/clockworkpi/uConsole/wiki).  

If you want to use the 4G extension, you can find helpful tips on how to use it on the [uConsole Wiki](https://github.com/clockworkpi/uConsole/wiki/How-to-use-the-4G-extension).

## uConsole Keyboard Firmware
Build the current firmware and upload tools with `make flash-bundle`; the
result is `build/uconsole_keyboard_flash-OS-ARCH.tar.gz`. Use a bundle built
for the machine that will perform the upload. Release users normally receive
this flasher inside the larger Workbench archive. The
[flashing guide](Bin/uconsole_keyboard_flash/README.md) describes requirements
and error handling.

Here's how you can flash the firmware on uConsole(A06 or CM4) or a PC running Ubuntu 22.04:

1. Build or obtain the current flashing bundle for the upload machine.
2. Extract the archive, substituting its target: `tar xzf uconsole_keyboard_flash-OS-ARCH.tar.gz`.
3. Install the required package using the following command: `sudo apt install -y dfu-util`.
4. Navigate to the extracted directory: `cd uconsole_keyboard_flash`.
5. Execute the flash script with root privileges: `sudo ./flash.sh`.
6. If everything goes well, you will see a progress bar indicating the flashing process.
7. If the command fails, retain its output and follow the flashing guide before retrying. A failed upload is not reported as success.

## Gearbox 

### A06 
Gearbox is a script tool used to adjust the big.LITTLE architecture of the A06 chip.  
you can get it by running 
```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install -y devterm-gearbox-a06
```

In latest os image of A06, default Gearbox is set to use 4 LITTLE core with 816Mhz,GPU at 400Mhz

you can run `a06-gearbox` to see the current core status.

```
Current Status:
+-----------------------------------+-----------------+-----------+
|            Cortex-A53             |   Cortex-A72    | Mali-T860 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------+
| CPU 0  | CPU 1  | CPU 2  | CPU 3  | CPU 4  | CPU 5  |    GPU    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------+
| 816Mhz | 816Mhz | 816Mhz | 816Mhz |  OFF   |  OFF   |   400MHz  |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------+
CPU Governor: schedutil    GPU Governor: simple_ondemand
```

Run `sudo a06-gearbox -s [GEAR]` to set gear,GEAR would be 1,2,3,4,5,6

There are 6 gears in gearbox

```
               1 for simple writing tasks with long battery life.
               2 for browsing most websites with long battery life.
               3 for most 2D games and emulators.
               4 for playing videos and 3D games.
               5 for performance-first tasks.
               6 for max performance, max power (usage).

```
